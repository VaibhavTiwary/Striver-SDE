// You are given k identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.

// You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f
//  will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.

// Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks,
//  you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

// Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
