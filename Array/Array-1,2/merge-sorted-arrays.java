// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

// Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

// The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
// Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
// Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
// The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.


class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int midx = m - 1;
        int nidx = n - 1;
        int right = m + n - 1;

        //both array is sorted
        // so just check last elements and the one that is greater would go at last
        // ..1,2,3,0,0,0 and 2,5,6 here compare 3 and 6 as 6 > 3 so put 6 at last

        while (nidx >= 0) {
            if (midx >= 0 && nums1[midx] > nums2[nidx]) {
                nums1[right] = nums1[midx];
                midx--;
            } else {
                nums1[right] = nums2[nidx];
                nidx--;
            }
            right--;
        }
